<h4>We’re an international team whose region DOES NOT have a regional championship, how can we join FTC VN?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Say hi to us through email with some information (e.g. when and where the team is founded, whether you have joined any tournament before, your assigned region, etc.), and we will provide extra support. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, teams can check what region they are assigned to on the <a href="https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/">FTC Events</a> page by looking up their team number. Teams in regions that do not have a local program delivery partner, or who are geographically isolated within their home region can work with FIRST by emailing <a href="mailto:ftcteams@firstinspires.org">ftcteams@firstinspires.org</a> to get reassigned to another more accessible region for advancement. If you’re specifically interested in joining FTC VN, please cc FTC VN Team <a href="mailto:robotics@fe.edu.vn">robotics@fe.edu.vn</a> to keep us updated on your request. </p>
