      Sibling teams are teams that fall to one of the following conditions: 1) representing the same school/organization/education system, 2) both teams have at least 2 members each from the same school/organization/education system, or 3) the team has at least 2 members who have participated in another FTC team operating in the Vietnam region.

      Sibling teams are eligible to compete in all events of FTC VN but only one of them will be eligible to advance to the World Championship from FTC VN. In the case two sibling teams secure the Inspire Award and 1st Place Alliance Captain, only the Inspire Award winner and the subsequent team according to the Advancement Order (i.e. 1st Place Alliance Partner) will advance.
